          It can be hard trying to get kids to read and focus at the same time.
          I know how hard it is because I have been there.
          <p>
            Being a teacher of elementary school for at least 3 months of my
            life exposed me to the power of visuals and imagery in the
            intellectual building of kids.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, I used to think “why so important” but soon I realised it
            should never be less important. Otherwise, a child would struggle to
            focus while learning and even lose the fun part of learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what StoryAi will help you achieve for your kid as a teacher
            and as a parent.
          </p>
        </p>
        <h3 className="BlogDetails__sub-heading">Reasons you should use StoryAi for your kids</h3>
        <ul className="BlogDetails__ul">
          <li>
            <b>It helps to keep focus while reading</b>: Kids struggle to focus
            while reading but with an Ai that can display written stories in
            imagery form your kid can focus better while reading stories
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>It improves the comprehension of your kids</b>: Have you ever
            asked yourself why kids could forget what was read to them in a
            second? That’s because their mental capacity is too low to absorb
            whatever is not exciting. Visuals make reading exciting for kids and
            in return it helps their mental comprehension and improve their
            retention of new knowledge.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>It improves reading interest</b>: StoryAi makes reading fun for
            your kid even for the kids who seem to have low interest in reading.
            This is a good way to improve yor kid’s interest in reading
