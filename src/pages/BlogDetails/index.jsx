//           It can be hard trying to get kids to read and focus at the same time.
//           I know how hard it is because I have been there.
//           <p>
//             Being a teacher of elementary school for at least 3 months of my
//             life exposed me to the power of visuals and imagery in the
//             intellectual building of kids.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             At first, I used to think “why so important” but soon I realised it
//             should never be less important. Otherwise, a child would struggle to
//             focus while learning and even lose the fun part of learning.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             This is what StoryAi will help you achieve for your kid as a teacher
//             and as a parent.
//           </p>
//         </p>
//         <h3 className="BlogDetails__sub-heading">Reasons you should use StoryAi for your kids</h3>
//         <ul className="BlogDetails__ul">
//           <li>
//             <b>It helps to keep focus while reading</b>: Kids struggle to focus
//             while reading but with an Ai that can display written stories in
//             imagery form your kid can focus better while reading stories
//           </li>

//           <li>
//             <b>It improves the comprehension of your kids</b>: Have you ever
//             asked yourself why kids could forget what was read to them in a
//             second? That’s because their mental capacity is too low to absorb
//             whatever is not exciting. Visuals make reading exciting for kids and
//             in return it helps their mental comprehension and improve their
//             retention of new knowledge.
//           </li>

//           <li>
//             <b>It improves reading interest</b>: StoryAi makes reading fun for
//             your kid even for the kids who seem to have low interest in reading.
//             This is a good way to improve yor kid’s interest in reading
//           </li>
