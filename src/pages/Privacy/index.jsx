          locations. Story AI also uses a variety of technical and
          organisational measures to help protect your personal information from
          unauthorised access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction
          consistent with applicable data protection laws, guidelines, and
          standards.
        </p>
        <h2>your privacy rights</h2>
        <p>
          The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as Amended),
          the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019, and other applicable data
          protection laws provide certain rights for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are entitled to request details of the information we hold about
          you and how we process it. You have the right to have your personal
          data rectified or erased/deleted, restrict our processing of that
          information, to stop transfers of your personal information to a third
          party and, in some circumstances, to have personal information
          relating to you transferred to another service provider/organisation.
          You also have the right to lodge a complaint concerning Story AI’s
          processing of your personal information with a regulatory authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you object to the processing of your personal information, or if
          you have provided your consent to processing and you later choose to
          withdraw it, we will respect that choice in accordance with our legal
          obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent,
          we may be able to continue to process your personal information to the
          extent required or otherwise permitted by law, particularly in
          connection with exercising and defending our legal rights or meeting
          our legal and regulatory obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to inform us of updates to any information you may have
          with us, you may also request that Story AI provides information
          collected from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
          format, where technically feasible. Story AI, in accordance with its
          obligation under relevant laws shall notify you of our compliance with
          all such requests that you may have made in accordance with your
          rights under laws
        </p>
        <h2>transferring your information internationally</h2>
        <p>
          The information we collect about you may be transferred, used, or
          stored in any country where we have operations or where we engage
          service providers. That means that your information may be transferred
          to a different country than where it was collected and which may not
          provide equivalent levels of data protection as Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level of Data protection in countries outside Nigeria may be less
          than that offered within Nigeria. Where this is the case, Story AI
          will implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal
          information remains protected and secure in accordance with applicable
          data protection laws, guidelines, and standards in Nigeria at the
          least. Nigerian standard contractual clauses are in place between all
          Story AI entities that share and process personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where our third-party service providers process personal data outside
          Nigeria in the course of providing services to us, our written
          agreement with them will include appropriate measures, usually
          standard contractual clauses on data sharing in accordance with
          prevailing local and international standards.
        </p>
        <h2>return policy</h2>

        <p>
          We may need to update, modify or amend our Privacy Policy as our
          technology evolves and as required by law. If we materially change the
          ways in which we use or share personal data previously collected from
          you through our Services, we will provide notice or obtain consent
